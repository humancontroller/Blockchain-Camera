I hope that the NFT Camera will create one great NFT art collection.
For that, artists need to be interested in NFT Camera.
I may do activities for that in the future.

And I consider the NFT Camera use case.
I'm thinking about whether NFT Camera can prove that it's not fake by Ai but actually taken photos.
Although I don't have a good idea for that right now.
